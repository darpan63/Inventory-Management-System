# Inventory Management System

A scalable microservices-based inventory management system designed to optimize inventory tracking and operations. This system is developed using Spring Boot and leverages multiple modern tools and technologies, including service discovery, API Gateway, event-driven architecture with Kafka, authentication via Keycloak, and real-time monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.

## About

The Inventory Management System is built to help organizations manage their inventory seamlessly using a microservices architecture. The system is designed with scalability and resilience in mind, ensuring that inventory tracking and operations can handle high volumes of transactions and data. Key features include:

- **Microservices Architecture:** Isolated services for inventory processing, order management, and more.
- **Service Discovery & API Gateway:** Simplified service interaction and routing.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Powered by Kafka for asynchronous communication.
- **Secure Authentication:** Managed through Keycloak for robust identity and access management.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implemented with Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and health.

## Architecture Overview

The system is divided into several key components:

- **Inventory Service:** Handles core inventory operations.
- **Order Service:** Manages order processing and inventory deduction.
- **API Gateway:** A unified entry point that routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
- **Service Discovery:** Dynamically registers and locates services.
- **Event Bus (Kafka):** Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices.
- **Authentication Service (Keycloak):** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Monitoring Stack:** Uses Prometheus for data collection and Grafana for visualizing system metrics.

This layered and modular design enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of maintenance.

  - Keycloak

- **Monitoring & Visualization:**  
  - Prometheus (metrics collection)  
  - Grafana (dashboard and visualization)

- **Build & Dependency Management:**  
  - Maven or Gradle

- **Containerization (Optional):**  
  - Docker
